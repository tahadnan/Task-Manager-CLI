## **Task Manager**

**Description:**

This Python project is a simple task manager application that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. It's a small-scale project designed to reinforce concepts learned in the ZTM Python course by Andrei Neagoie.

- **Add tasks:** Users can add new tasks to the to-do list.
- **Remove tasks:** Users can remove tasks from the to-do list.

- **View current state:** Users can view a list of all tasks, both pending and completed.
- **Clear lists:** Users can clear both the to-do and done lists.

**Usage:**

1. **Install dependencies:** Ensure you have Python installed. If using a virtual environment, activate it. (no needed dependencies currently)
2. **Run the application:** Execute the `main.py` file.
